# Return on Investment for Student Internships
---
This project analyzes the return on investment for students who have completed one or more internships throughout the duration of their undergraduate degree, and aims to predict future employment and salary outcomes for students upon graduation using the following questions:

* What is the effect of at least one internship on graduating with FTE or Continuing Education?
* What is the effect of at least one internship on graduating with FTE?
* What is the effect of at least one internship on graduating with CE?
* What is the effect of at least one internship on starting salary for students who are FTE?
* Does completing at least one internship lead to a higher hiring rate?

## Technologies
- Language: Python3
- Data Analysis: Pandas, ... (TBD)
- Machine Learning Tools: (TBD)
- Visualization: PowerBI or MATPLOTLIB (TBD)

## Progress
Currently, we are in the beginning stages of analysis with a prediction model to come. 

More information will be added soon.
